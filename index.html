   	 <h1>Hello, I'm Eleanor RobinðŸ˜‰</h1>

       <p>
       	I have been expatriated for 6 years, first in Romania and then in South Korea. I am studying at IESEG School of Management, and I have matured my future project. I intend to be active in the field of ecological transition in an international context.

   	<h2>My life in Seoul - SOUTH KOREA</h2>
   	<img src="images/SouthKorea.jpeg" width="300px" alt="Seoul">
     <p>
   		Seoul was the expatriation that stood out the most for me.
   	 </p>
   	 <p>
   		First, Seoul is known for its strong soft-power: K-pop, K-dramas. But also for its royal palaces like Gyeongbokgung palace, Buddhist temples, bright colors, curvy roods.
   	 </p>
   	 <p>
   	 	Second, the food is really good. I love kimchi, a spicy, fermented cabbage dish that will set your taste buds on fire (in a good way), and also bibimbap, my favorite dish, and delicious kimbap.
   	 </p>
   	 <p>
   	 	Moreover, there are convenient stores on every corner, they are open 24/7. So if you have a small craving of noodles at 2 a.m., no problem!
   	 </p>
   	 <p>
   		Finally, I loved working at coffee shops and doing Photoshoot in cabins with my friends and family. These spots are very popular in Korea.

   	<h2>My life in Bucharest - ROMANIA</h2>
   	<img src="images/Romania.jpeg" width="300px" alt="Bucarest">
     <p>
    	Bucarest was also a great experience. 
    	I met beautiful people there, including my two best friends with whom I am always in touch with. 
     </p>
     <p>
    	I fell in love with the castle of Sibiu and Bran (Dracula's legendary dwelling), but also the beautiful TransfÄƒgÄƒrÄƒÈ™an in Transilvania.
     </p>
     <p>
     	Romanian cuisine is rich in flavors and traditional dishes. You may enjoy dishes like mÄƒmÄƒligÄƒ (a kind of polenta), mici (delicious grilled sausages), and sarmale (stuffed cabbage leaves). Desserts ike papanaÈ™i (donuts) and cozonac (braided brioche) are also delicious.

     <h2>My projects</h2>
     <img src="images/action.jpeg" width="300px" alt="projects">
      <p>
   		I created a project called "Nouvelle Vogue" in 2022, for the Mot d'or competition and won the title of Laureate. It promotes the re-use of clothes and the short circuit through an application. 
   	  </p>
   	  <p>
   		I also did an internship at the Green Climate Fund, in Incheon, near Seoul, in South Korea, in May 2023. 
   	  </p>
   	  <p>
   		I recently joined the association ACT at IESEG (Action for Climate Change and Transition), working for the sponsor pole.
